NOTES:
* Do not forget to extract Property.class from authlib
* For system to work, replace all links to *.mojang.com servers to yours
* For skins to work replace Property.class in authlib with mine
  Also replace one of .mojang.com or .minecraft.net domains to your in order to say Minecraft
  that your server is valid and whitelisted


CURRENT BUGS:
BUG: Cape is using skin texture. I really don't understand it! When requesting image through browser or Insomnia using
     link in payload, proper skin is downloading, but in game used skin texture... Still needed to investigate it.



FIXES NEEDED ASAP:




IMPLEMENT:




FIXED:
FXD: serverId SQL column max length. How long it should be? No idea, check through debugger (Maybe 64?)
     -  Data length is 40-41. DB length set to 48
FXD: Fixed path to user skin. Path contained "capes" instead "skins", it might be issue with skin signature
     in Yggdrasil
FXD: Fixed cape payload, game tried to draw cape, but it had skin texture. EmbedIO supports only one static folder?



CHECK:




IMPLEMENTED:
IMPD: Offline authentication and skin request
IMPD: Mojang Authentication server-alike schema
IMPD: Authentication and login on server with online-mode=true
IMPD: Skins on servers with online-mode=true
IMPD: Skin and cape upload to server
IMPD: Server user registration api
IMPD: Get downloadable data and files
